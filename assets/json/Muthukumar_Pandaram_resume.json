Computational geometrical techniques were used to develop the algorithm which mainly focused on improving the runtime and accuracy of registration over existing algorithm like ICP. \n\nThe results showed a great improvement in accuracy and runtime and both the parameters were independent of the initial relative alignments of the CAD surface and scanned 3D pointset which is a major advantage of my proposed method over the most commonly used ICP which had a problem of convergence to a local minima when there was a large misalignment between the pointsets. This makes my proposed method more suitable for enabling automation in the free form surface inspection using laser scanning. \nThe code of the algorithm was created in MATLAB.",
