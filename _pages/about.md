I am currently an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. My research focuses on robot perception and learning. I am passionate about neuro-inspired representation learning. 
I am primarily part of the [Intelligent and Interactive Systems](https://iis.uibk.ac.at/start) research group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck. My primary supervisor is [Prof. Justus Piater](https://iis.uibk.ac.at/people/justus) and I am co-supervised by [Prof. Matthias Bethge](https://bethgelab.org/) from the University of Tübingen.

I did my Master's in Computational Neuroscience at the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Berlin](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/) (Degree jointly awarded by the Technical University of Berlin and Humboldt University of Berlin) and Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, India. 

I have been fortunate to work with different labs across the world. I have worked as a graduate research assistant with [Prof.Oliver Brock](https://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/oliver_brock/) at the Robotics and Biology Lab, TU Berlin. Furthermore, I did my Master thesis with [Prof. MD. Andreas Horn](https://www.discoverbrigham.org/andreas-horn-md-phd/) at the Network Stimulation Lab at the Charité University Hospital, Berlin and Harvard Medical College, Boston. Additionally, during my Bachelor's, I have done internships at the National University of Singapore, University of Leeds, UK and McMaster University, Ontario, Canada.
