I am currently an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. My research focuses on robot perception and learning. I am passionate about neuro-inspired representation learning. 
I am primarily part of the [Intelligent and Interactive Systems](https://iis.uibk.ac.at/start) research group at the Department of Computer Science. My primary supervisor is [Prof. Justus Piater](https://iis.uibk.ac.at/people/justus) and I am co-supervised by [Prof. Matthias Bethge](https://bethgelab.org/) from the University of TÃ¼bingen.
